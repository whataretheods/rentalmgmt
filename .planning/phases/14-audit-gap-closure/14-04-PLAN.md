<objective>
Update traceability documentation to reflect Phase 14 gap closures and ensure all requirement statuses are accurate.

Purpose: The v2.0 milestone audit identified that REQUIREMENTS.md traceability entries for Phase 13 still showed "Planned" instead of "Complete", and Phase 14 entries need to be marked as resolved. STATE.md needs to reflect Phase 14 progress.
Output: Updated REQUIREMENTS.md and STATE.md with accurate traceability.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability for Phase 14</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
    In `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`, make the following updates:

    **Change 1 — Phase 14 traceability table:**
    In the `### v2.0+ (Phase 14 — Gap Closure)` section, change all 7 entries from `Planned` to `Complete`:
    ```
    | INFRA-03 | Phase 14 | Complete |
    | LEDG-03 | Phase 14 | Complete |
    | LATE-02 | Phase 14 | Complete |
    | OPS-02 | Phase 14 | Complete |
    | FIN-04 | Phase 14 | Complete |
    | AUX-02 | Phase 14 | Complete |
    | OPS-04 | Phase 14 | Complete |
    ```

    **Change 2 — Coverage counts:**
    Update the coverage section at the bottom:
    ```
    - v2.0+ gap closure: 7 requirement gaps addressed in Phase 14 (all complete)
    ```

    **Change 3 — Last updated note:**
    Update the last line: `*Last updated: 2026-02-28 after Phase 14 completion*`

    Do NOT change any other section of the file. The Phase 13 entries were already updated to "Complete" in a prior commit.

  <done>
    All 7 Phase 14 requirement gaps marked as Complete in traceability.
    Coverage counts are accurate.
    Last updated timestamp reflects Phase 14 completion.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update STATE.md to reflect Phase 14 completion</name>
  <files>.planning/STATE.md</files>
  <action>
    In `.planning/STATE.md`, update the following fields:

    **status:** `in_progress` (Phase 14 is underway; executor will mark complete on final plan)
    **stopped_at:** `Executing Phase 14 gap closure plans`
    **last_updated:** Current ISO timestamp
    **last_activity:** `2026-02-28`
    **Current focus:** `Phase 14 — Audit Gap Closure (in progress)`
    **Phase:** `14 of 14 (Audit Gap Closure) — in progress`
    **Plan:** `14-04 (in progress) — 4 of 4 plans`
    **total_phases:** `14`
    **total_plans:** `69` (65 prior + 4 new)

    Update the progress bar to reflect 69/73 or appropriate total.

    Also update the **Session Continuity** section:
    ```
    **Last Session:** 2026-02-28
    **Stopped At:** Executing 14-04-PLAN.md (traceability cleanup) -- Phase 14 in progress
    **Resume File:** None
    ```

    Do NOT change the Decisions, Pending Todos, or other accumulated context sections — they remain valid.

    Plan counts are accurate (69 total).
    Session continuity section updated.
